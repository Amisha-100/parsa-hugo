There’s a general conception that we believe in. We believe that we are a certain type of personality, certain type of being; but the truth is different.

We all are a universal being and just like the infinite universe; our power is infinite. Universe keeps on expanding all the time and so should we. We need to untap the side which is hidden in us, which we think never exists. Despite your present situation and lifestyle, there are so many domains you can still explore, there’s so much more you can still create. It doesn’t matter if you are at the top of your field or are just beginning, there are still multiple sides of yours that are unexplored. You are limitless. There’s always growth and we can grow!

#### **How to tap the untapped you?**

* **Explore**

The answer lies in trying new things, doing different activities, following your heart, going for a new venture. It’s about exploring, doing the practical stuff, taking bold moves by trying out everything you wished to. Living a life filled with exploration will fill your life with newness, hope and joy. You never know, any single activity can take you, as a person, to another level. This is the way of becoming more aware about yourself and digging into deeper sides of you. But exploration needs to be done in a certain way. And the way is ...

* **Self-awareness**

See, the world has so much, literally so much! There are so many jobs you can take up, things you can try, places you can meet, people you can greet and what not. So, if you just start exploring from nowhere, frankly speaking, that would require more time than your life. So, before you explore the outer world, you need to peek into your inner world. You need to see through your thought process, know your very existence and then create your own purpose. This will not only bring clarity in your actions but also give you pure happiness. Being self-aware automatically elevates your level and gives you a higher purpose. That’s how you make the process of tapping the untapped you practically achievable.

#### **Tapping the intangible**

Ok, tapping tangible (physical) things around us is pretty simple. I can tap my couch, my pen, my notebook and what not. However, tapping the intangible you is a challenge. To make this challenge easier, let’s gain a deeper understanding about the conscious and unconscious brain.

* **Consciousness**

Consciousness is your state of mind that is created by you or your environment. It’s where we tell ourselves. It’s more mechanical, forced and greatly influenced by our upbringing and surrounding.

* **Sub-consciousness**

Subconsciousness has a different story to offer. It’s a state of mind where your brain doesn’t need any outer force to act. It’s where things happen automatically, where magic starts to occur. When something is emphasized enough by our conscious brain, it automatically gets into our subconscious. So, if we keep thinking about tapping ourselves, about growing and rising enough times, we are training our subconscious to think through these concepts, all by itself.

There’s more that you can get out of you, there’s more that you can give out of you and there’s much more you can do with what you are. This is only possible when you take conscious efforts towards making the idea of “tapping the untapped you” go into your subconscious.

  
Let me tell you a secret:

> The world is waiting to see the UNTAPPED YOU!
