'**Technology**' is the technical extension of the human mind. And the human mind is the governor of the world. All the advancement in this world is because of the creativity and passion of humans which eventually lead to a technology- driven world. Most of the things surrounding us is a part and parcel of technology; right from fridge to water heater, from fans to ACs, from cars to jets, from internet to AI, from TVs to the miniature gadget which seems to grab everyone's eyeballs viz. Smart phones, from social media to having our own personal assistant, etc are boons of technology.

In the good olden days, sending a letter was taking a few months, connecting to a call took a few hours but due to the rise of social media and the fast networking agencies, we can do everything in a few seconds. Booking up the railway and flight tickets took an individual to spend almost half a day in the queue but now, it is a matter of half an hour with various online travel booking websites as well as the government taking initiative to be a part of this new digital era. Traveling via bullock cart took days to reach from one city to another but now it's just a few hours away with your own Maruti or Honda or Mercedes or Bentley or … and the list goes on. Transferring money has become easier; digital wallets are the new trend and this helps globally to carry out transactions very efficiently and safely.

Online shopping is the new shop to buy groceries, clothes, electronic gadgets, shoes,etc and bid goodbye to wandering in the crowded market for the perfect dress or pair of shoes. Education has also seen huge transformation due to technology; various online courses from top most universities are available for students. Also technology has given rise to new professions like YouTuber, Instagrammer, Influencers, etc. Also various technical jobs are booming up. Medical field has seen the advancement in surgery, addition of new and effective medicines, discovery of antidotes, etc all due to technology. AI, ML and Data Science are the new heroes of our technical movie.

The field of technology has seen immense amount of growth in the last two decades right from the January 1, 1983; the birthday of the internet to the dot com bubble which is in the year 1995 to 2004, to the age of social media and right now the current pandemic occurred due to coronavirus has lead to the internet becoming one of the most helpful and trustworthy resource on which entire world is connected to. It is to be noted that ‘Internet is made up of technology and technology is made up of internet.’

Some of the field which everyone can step into and make notable contributions are:

(**NOTE:** This is the path to guide you to get started but ultimately, your learning path has to be yours and learn the way you like it!)

* **Machine Learning:**

Machine Learning is the field of possibilities and probabilities. It helps humans to make machines smarter and enhance human efforts.

Machine Learning is going to change the course of software development and make a system which is interactive and personalized.

**_Let’s talk about the steps to go with →_**

1. Start with python (Get the basics right)
2. Start learning Linear Algebra
3. Start with Probability
4. Now, you are ready to understand the machine learning algorithms
5. After that look for frameworks like tensorflow, pytorch, keras, etc. and choose one for you.

But it is a well known fact that every coin has two sides. Due to too much addictive nature towards technology, it has led to empty grounds and gardens. Also there is a whole virtual connection all around but rarely an authentic connection with each other. Nuclear weapons can lead to destruction of the whole world. Growing illness and mental health issues have become a Gordian knot. With all the advancement in the field of technology, we are suffering the cost of additional baggage which it brings for free. Although, technology is our friend but it may turn out to be our ghastly enemy.

But the power is always in the hands of the users. Technology is our greatest friend but if it isn't handled properly can be our enemy too!

As we look towards the brighter side of life, we will always find the growth of the entire world is much faster and the world is truly becoming a better place to live in 2021 and all the upcoming years. Kudos to technology and its creators who are helping to make the unreal real and always let us wonder how surreal everything is! You can also be part of the clan and enjoy this power and become the ironman or the wonder woman around your community or maybe globally just like Elon Musk.

Looking at the past and present scenario; I can surely bet that technology is our friend and hope that in near future it will always share the same healthy relationship with the world. The tech revolution has just started and there’s room for everyone here as it is across the globe. Time is now! Just prepare for it using the internet and just make your mark upon it just like Steve Jobs!

Hoping to see all the wonder women and ironmen in 2021 and creating tech for all and supporting the tech revolution. So, gear up in 2020 and be the leader in 2021!
