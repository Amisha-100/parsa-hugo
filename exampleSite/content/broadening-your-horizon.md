**Horizon** is a place where land and sky meet. It breaks conventional barriers. Similarly, every human being is magical enough to break the limits and create their own vision, thus broadening their horizon and changing the world in their own way. So, let no limits hold you back and jump onto the journey of discovering the limitless you!

[Broadening Your Horizon by Exploreee • A podcast on Anchor](https://anchor.fm/exploreee/episodes/Broadening-Your-Horizon-ehrr5g/a-a2t5ks1 "Podcast")

Before getting into the discussion, let us first ponder over this question:

### Why is it important to broaden your horizon?

Our mind is exceptionally powerful in creating new ideas. We can create anything! If you see the world around, you will be surely fascinated with the things that are done, but far more fascinated with the things that are yet to be done, ideas that are yet to be created, and philosophies that are yet to be formed. Despite learning a subject or working in a domain, you have the power to learn more and create more. You can and you must venture into things that interest you. Such a mindset will inspire you every day, thus helping you to push yourself. Hence, to tap the untapped human potential, we must broaden our horizon.

### How to broaden your horizon?

Since childhood, we have been taught to think in a certain way, act in a certain way, and what not. Our surroundings have always had an enormous impact on our behavior. However, now it’s time to break the ‘certain way’ and create your own unique way. It’s time to redefine your ideas and your work ethic. You should listen to the people around you, but do what you think is right. This is the core aim of broadening your horizon.

It’s about thinking about new ideas which can make you wonder. So, don’t limit yourself. Set your mind, set your heart, and most importantly set yourself free from any barriers which block you to think ahead of what has already been thought. See, there’s no endpoint. There’s always something more in life. This thought should excite you to find, rather create something new.

Once you start broadening your mindset, you will start trying new things, doing new things, failing at some, learning from some, and ultimately growing and inspiring the world in your own way! So, what are you waiting for? Go with your free mind, see the world with excitement, and spread love, peace, and light all around you!
